<p>I make recruitment simple providing what candidates and clients want through the application of expert engineering knowledge and building relationships that endure the test of time.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked in the IT, Telecom and Satellite recruitment services for 25 years and as an employee set-up, led, directed and contributed to the management of several small recruitment companies. My career started in the mobile radio sector leading the work on software engineering quality management. I set up NMR after a 7-month motorcycle trip across the Americas with my wife.</p>
